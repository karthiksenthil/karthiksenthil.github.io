title: "[GSoC 2016] Community Bonding - First Post"
---

Hello all!

This year as part of Google Summer of Code 2016 I will continue working on <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry'>ruby_curry</a>, extending it to a full fledged compiler implementation for FlatCurry, a flavour of the functional logic programming language <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry_(programming_language)'>Curry</a>.

More details about the project can be found <a href='https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4517222395412480'>here</a>.

After discussions with my mentor, Prof. Antoy, I have decided to spend the initial part of the Community Bonding period for the following -
<ol>
<li> Status Report - detailed draft of current status of ruby_curry w.r.t. features and bugs </li>
<li> Setting up <a href='https://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~pakcs/'>PAKCS</a> and <a href='https://www-ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/kics2/'>KiCS2</a> on local machine </li>
<li> Survey on the above compilers </li>
</ol>

Looking forward to learn more :)

P.S. : And yes, this year I will update about my progress in this project through regular blog posts on my personal website itself.
