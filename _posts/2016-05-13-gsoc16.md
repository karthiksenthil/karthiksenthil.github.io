title: "[GSoC 2016] Codebase status report and installing KiCS2"

Hello all!

This post is to update about my progress in generating a status report for the ruby_curry codebase. I have logically divided the code repo into components and have started documenting the working of each component. The ongoing copy of the report can be viewed <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O6udc8el6X_P1nZt1bk_gMCTw0W4PY-swhsPnx1Fs-o/edit?usp=sharing'>here</a>. I will continue updating this document over the next week.

Regarding the installation of <a href='https://www-ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/kics2/index.html'>KiCS2</a>, I carried out the following steps :
<ol>
<li> installing GHC(The Glasgow Haskell Compiler) and Cabal </li>
<li> downloading tar of latest release of KiCS2 and building natively </li>
</ol>

Intitally the Haskell compiler choked at linking as it by default used the <b>ld.gold</b> linker. This is a known <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13046319/haskell-ghc-compiling-linking-error-not-creating-executable-linux'>issue</a> which I solved by purging binutils-gold as suggested <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/a/13046709'>here</a>.

After this step, the KiCS2 build again failed with Cabal failing to install some packages due to unmet dependencies. I am currently working on getting around this issue. The missing dependencies include <i>comonad 5</i>, <i>semigroupoids-5.0.1</i> and <i>mtl-2.2.1</i>. I have tried natively installing these dependencies from source(Github), but the build still seems to fail for same reason. I will try other possible steps to solve this problem and go ahead with exploring the features of KiCS2.
