title: "[GSoC 2016] Completion of status report"
date : 2016-05-18
---

I have completed the brief status <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O6udc8el6X_P1nZt1bk_gMCTw0W4PY-swhsPnx1Fs-o/edit?usp=sharing'>report</a> of the current ruby_curry codebase. The report is organised into 3 main sections -
<ol>
<li> Installation/Usage instructions </li>
<li> Code Workflow </li>
<li> Directory-wise file descriptions </li>
</ol>

The primary purpose of the report is to document the current work so as to comprehensively evaluate the tool from scratch. The evaluation will aid in planning the first set of steps to be undertaken in the upcoming "Coding Phase" of GSoC. The document will also aid the users interested in using the current version of ruby_curry.

Please leave your comments/suggestions in the report :)

Looking forward to start the Coding Phase !
