title: "[GSoC 2016] Progress in RCurry"
date : 2016-06-12

Hello all!

Over the last week, I progressed in defining RCurry and correspondingly updated ICurryToAbstractRuby(the module to convert ICurry to RCurry). The current implementation can be used to compile and execute simple examples like `mynot` and `myappend`. There were many issues regarding lack of information available in ICurry which I tackled after discussions with my mentor. The source for <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry/blob/master/lib/RCurry.curry'>RCurry</a> and <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry/blob/master/lib/ICurryToAbstractRuby.curry'>ICurryToAbstractRuby</a> are available on the Github repository. A sample ruby object code produced by this version of the system can be found <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry/blob/master/lib/mynot.rb'>here</a>.

This week I plan on completing the full support for converting ICurry to RCurry and also improve the ruby runtime environment with features like Modules and Builtin data types. I also plan on working on a new test suite for ruby_curry by verifying the compilation made using ICurry and RCurry.
