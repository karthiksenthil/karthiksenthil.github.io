title: "[GSoC 2016] Cleanup and progress for mid evaluations"
date : 2016-06-15

This week I've been working on tasks to prepare ruby_curry for a version release on Github and the GSoC mid evaluations.

I've added the module/namespace feature in the ruby object code and also provided support for integers in the runtime environment. I also did some code cleanup and removed obsolete code in the old codebase that is used on the try server.

This weekend I plan on merging the 2 repositories i.e try server codebase and Github repository. This would enable people to use the first minimal version of ruby_curry for their usage. I also plan on revamping the current test suite for the project. The updated list of TODO tasks can be found <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry/blob/master/TODO'>here</a>.
