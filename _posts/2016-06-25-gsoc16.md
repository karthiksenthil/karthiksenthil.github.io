title: "[GSoC 2016] Progress on External runtime functions"
date : 2016-06-25
---

After the codebase merge a lot of new tasks and issues turned up. One of the important tasks is adding runtime support for externally defined functions in <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry/blob/master/lib/Prelude.rb'>Prelude</a>. I have made a complete <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry/blob/master/docs/DOUBTS'>list</a> of unimplemented External functions and their priorities. Current status of this module can be found <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry/blob/master/lib/CT_External.rb'>here</a>.

Before this task I also worked on making a more robust <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry/blob/master/test/test_positives.rb'>test suite</a> in ruby. All tests can be run using the `rake test` command and in order to force recompile all intermediate files from scratch for testing, the command `rake ftest` can be used.

I am currently working of refactoring <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry/blob/master/src/compiler/expressions.rb'>expressions.rb</a> to facilitate the definition of some External functions.

The complete list of upcoming tasks can be found <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry/blob/master/docs/TODO'>here</a>.
