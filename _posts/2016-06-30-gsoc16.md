title: "[GSoC 2016] Refactoring of expressions"
date : 2016-06-30

Hello all!

I spent the last few days working on refactoring the old expressions.rb (in ruby runtime environment) into a revamped `CT_Expressions` module. This solves the issue of namespaces thus giving flexibility to names being used in the Curry programs. The entire module is divided into 4 files - <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry/blob/master/src/compiler/CT_Expressions.rb'>expression class definitions</a>, <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry/blob/master/src/compiler/CT_Expressions_print.rb'>expression printing</a>, <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry/blob/master/src/compiler/CT_Expressions_equality.rb'>expression equality</a> and <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry/blob/master/src/compiler/CT_Expressions_utils.rb'>expression utilities</a>. We tested this new module on all the existing test cases.

After this refactoring I moved ahead to implement the equality operation <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry/blob/master/docs/equality-algorithm.txt'>algorithm</a> in `CT_External` which has also been completed now. 

I am now working on the Prelude compare operation based on this <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry/blob/master/docs/compare-algorithm.txt'>algorithm</a>.
