title: "[GSoC 2016] Updates on external functions"

Hello all!

I spent the last week working on tasks related to extending support for more external functions in runtime environment and integrating variables into different sections of ruby_curry.

After implementing free variables and the concept of Narrowing there are a couple of Curry examples which run into an infinite loop during runtime execution (<a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry/blob/master/curry_examples/last_1.curry'>last_1</a>, <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry/blob/master/curry_examples/length_narrow.curry'>length_narrow</a>). We identified that this problem was arising due to a design issue in FlatCurry. We are planning to solve this by making changes to ICurry directly in order to bring about minimum changes in ruby_curry.

Apart from this, as mentioned in previous post, the generator table expressions are now bound freshly during runtime instead of compile time. I also worked on moving `integers` into a separate module `CT_Integer` which was a long pending task.

The upcoming tasks have been updated in <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry/blob/master/docs/TODO'>TODO</a> which mainly include new external functions like =:=, cond and solving some issues like support for variables in external functions.
