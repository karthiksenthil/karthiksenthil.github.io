title: "[GSoC 2016] Documentation and upcoming tasks"

The last week was focussed on some minor tasks like code cleanup, updating TODO and looking into implementations of equality-constraint operators like `cond` and `=:=`.

Since I am new to the Curry syntax and semantics it is taking some more time to understand the difference between these operators and coming up with Curry tests to differentiate between their execution. I will work on them over the next few days.

Along with this, I will also start work on documenting the overall design scheme, stages accomplished, assessment, evaluation pipeline, etc. of ruby_curry. This will act as a guide to anybody interested in continuing the current stage of work in the compiler system.

The progress of ruby_curry can always be tracked <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry'>here</a>.
