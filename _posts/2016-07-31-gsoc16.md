title: "[GSoC 2016] Documentation of ruby_curry"
date : 2016-07-31
---

Due to upcoming time constraints I have decided to focus on the important task of documenting the design of ruby_curry. This will be a very critical document to guide any new developers interested in this project.

I have started initial work towards this and the current status can be viewed online <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry/blob/master/docs/Documentation.md'>here</a>. I will spend the upcoming week on the same task.
