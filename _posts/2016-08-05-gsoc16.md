title: "[GSoC 2016] Progress in ruby_curry documentation"
date : 2016-08-05
---

Last week I worked mainly on updating the document describing the design, execution and evaluation of ruby_curry. I was able to complete the "Translation" unit and have described the pipeline in this stage including a detailed account of RCurry - the Ruby based abstraction over ICurry. The progress can be observed <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry/blob/master/docs/Documentation.md'>here</a>.

I will next work on documenting the "Object code" and "Runtime" units. I will also be discussing with my mentor about the future work and directions for more work regarding this tool.
