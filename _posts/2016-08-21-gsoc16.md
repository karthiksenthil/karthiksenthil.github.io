Hello all!

It has been a very interesting and fruitful journey this GSoC, specifically with the progress made in ruby_curry's usability and range of programs that can be currently compiled with it.

There are still many avenues for improvements like :
<ul>
<li> Completing CT_External.rb with all support for External functions </li>
<li> With introduction of suppport for Variables, many unimplemented edge cases can be implemented</li>
<li> A fully compiled, distributable binary for ruby_curry</li>
<li> More documentation regarding the details of ICurry and pipeline followed</li>
<li> Any interesting feature or extension to improve the performance of the compiler as a whole. Possible direction could be in ICurry translation module. </li>
</ul>

The current status of the project can be viewed online <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil/ruby_curry'>here</a>.

I would be more than happy to guide anybody interested in learning or pursuing any part of this work. The ultimate aim of ruby_curry is to act as an ideal research playground which can be used by students and researchers working on functional logic programming paradigms.

As always you can contact me via <a href='https://github.com/karthiksenthil'>Github</a> or drop in an <a href='mailto:karthik.senthil94@gmail.com'>email</a> about your queries regarding this work. 

Looking forward to continue contributing to this prized project and overall to the dearest open source community :)
