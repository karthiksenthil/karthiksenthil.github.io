---

I'm Karthik Senthil pursuing my undergraduate degree from National Institute of Technology, Karnataka.

My interests lie in the fields of Programming Languages & Compilers and High Performance Computing. I'm an avid open source enthusiast and passionate about contributing to the community. I also play CTF(Capture the flag) contests with my team [No Internet Access](http://nia-labs.github.io/).

I enjoy reading fiction(Dan Brown and Archer fan!), playing basketball and trekking.
