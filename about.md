title: About
---

I'm Karthik Senthil pursuing my graduate studies in Computer Science from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

My interests lie in the fields of  High Performance Computing and Programming Models. I'm an avid open source enthusiast and passionate about contributing to the community. I also play CTF (Capture the flag) contests with my team [No Internet Access](http://nia-labs.github.io/).

I enjoy reading fiction (Dan Brown and Archer fan!), playing basketball and trekking.
